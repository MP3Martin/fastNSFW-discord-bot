<!-- https://discord.bots.gg/bots/987366356808773642 -->
#### Create **NSFW** **channels** **with ease**.
#### Features:


# Create NSFW channel

<h4><em><strong>Example video <a href="https://mp3martin.github.io/misc_gh_pages/video-example?id=KaXHbdBVElw" target="_blank">here</a></strong></em></h4>

Just create a channel with name starting with one of the prefixes. The prefix will get removed from the channel name and the channel will get marked as NSFW.

All the channel name prefixes you can use: **`nsfw-`**, **`nsfw_`**, **`nsfw+`**, **`ns-`**, **`ns_`**, **`ns+`**


# NSFW categories

<h4><em><strong>Example video <a href="https://mp3martin.github.io/misc_gh_pages/video-example?id=8VY7uceGmLI" target="_blank">here</a></strong></em></h4>

Include `ðŸ”ž` before the category name. All the channels in the category will be set as NSFW. Remove `ðŸ”ž` prefix from category name and the category channels will not be NSFW again. The bot also handles if you create a channel inside the NSFW category or move a channel in / out of NSFW category.

It basically works like if NSFW categories were official. The only difference is that you have to write `ðŸ”ž` before the category name instead of toggling a switch.
